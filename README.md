### Hello ðŸ‘‹ my name is Christopher

I am a systems developer student based in MalmÃ¶, Sweden. I have so far worked on projects revolving around webservices, database management, multi-threaded applications, sorting/searching algorithms, message communication and android development amongst others. Mostly focusing on OOP using Java, with Javascript, Python and MSSQL.

My course involves a lot of learning about and practising Agile processes, using modern techniques for software development.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about applied software architecture and research methodologies.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for an internship for autumn 2023 in the MalmÃ¶/Ã–resund area
